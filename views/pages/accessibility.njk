        Compliance status
      </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        This website is partially compliant with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Non-accessible content
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. 
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Cookie banner elements receive keyboard focus even if they are hidden on the page. As a result, the content order is not matched. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A) and 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A). 
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Some links are not descriptive of their purpose/destination. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A) and 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (Level AAA). 
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Status messages cannot be programmatically determined through role or properties in order that they can be presented to users by assistive technologies without receiving focus. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA).         
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        We plan to fix these accessibility issues by August 2025.  
      </p>
